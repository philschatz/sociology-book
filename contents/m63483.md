### To the Student   {#import-auto-id1163649988778}

This book is written for you and is based on the teaching and research experience of numerous sociologists. In today’s global socially networked world, the topic of sociology is more relevant than ever before. We hope that through this book, you will learn how simple, everyday human actions and interactions can change the world. In this book, you will find applications of sociology concepts that are relevant, current, and balanced.

### To the Instructor   {#import-auto-id1163651674898}

This text is intended for a one-semester introductory course. Since current events influence our social perspectives and the field of sociology in general, OpenStax encourages instructors to keep this book fresh by sending in your up-to-date examples to Support@OpenStax.org so that students and instructors around the country can relate and engage in fruitful discussions.

### General Approach   {#import-auto-id1163653051282}

*Introduction to Sociology 2e* adheres to the scope and sequence of a typical introductory sociology course. In addition to comprehensive coverage of core concepts, foundational scholars, and emerging theories we have incorporated section reviews with engaging questions, discussions that help students apply the sociological imagination, and features that draw learners into the discipline in meaningful ways. Although this text can be modified and reorganized to suit your needs, the standard version is organized so that topics are introduced conceptually, with relevant, everyday experiences.

### Changes to the Second Edition   {#eip-312}

Part of the mission of the second edition update was to ensure the research, examples and concepts used in this textbook are current and relevant to today’s student. To this end, we have rewritten the introduction of each chapter to reflect the latest developments in sociology, history and global culture. In addition to new graphs and images, the reader of the second edition will find new feature boxes on a diverse array of topics, which has been one of the goals of the update—bringing the world into greater focus through case studies on global culture.

For instance, since the first edition there have been major cultural shifts within the Middle East and Arab world—a movement still underway called the Arab Spring—changes that are now incorporated into our coverage on social movements and social unrest (Chapter 21, “Social Movements and Social Change”). New issues in immigration, in the United States and across the world, have been brought to the forefront of the second edition, as rising income gaps and modern transportation are responsible for trends in Europe (fears of Islamic conservatism and economic recession) and political debates in the U.S. (such as border security, universal education and health care).

Since the first edition in 2012, technology and social media has ushered in new forms of communication, and, of course, these changes are altering the fabric of social life around the world. The benefits and downfalls of new technologies are reflected in new material in Chapter 4, “Society and Social Interaction,” where we discuss how social media is changing classical models of social stratification and prestige.

In addition to updating critical facts, data, and policies from the first edition, we have expanded on essential topics, including:

| Feminism and feminist theory | Health care legislation |
| US social stratification | Minimum wage policies |
| Transgender issues and changes to the DSM-V | Global statistics on education |
| Marriage and pay equality | Competing theories of tolerance |
| The use of charter schools | Cyberbullying |
| Impact of economy on population segments | Climate change debates |
| Use of technology and social media by | Global population and demographic shifts |
| individuals and groups | Net neutrality, online privacy and security |
{: #eip-500 summary="Pictured is a two-column table. In the first column is 'Feminism and feminist theory,' 'US social stratification,' 'Transgender issues and changes to the DSM-V,' 'Marriage and pay equality,' 'The use of charter schools,' 'Impact of economy on population segments,' and 'Use of technology and social media by individuals and groups.' In the second column is 'Health care legislation,' 'Minimum wage policies,' 'Global statistics on education,' 'Competing theories of tolerance,' 'Cyberbullying,' 'Climate change debates,' 'Global population and demographic shifts,' and 'Net neutrality, online privacy and security.'" data-colsep="1" data-rowsep="0"}

Other topics received a light update for relevance and student engagement. The racial tensions that have come about through the cases of Trayvon Martin and Michael Brown, as well as the legalization of marijuana are two examples of such additions.

### Features of OpenStax Introduction to Sociology 2e   {#import-auto-id1163674682247}

We have retained and updated the special features of the original text for this updated version.

#### Modularity   {#import-auto-id1163649612762}

This textbook is organized on Connexions ([http://cnx.org][1]) as a collection of modules that can be rearranged and modified to suit the needs of a particular professor or class. That being said, modules often contain references to content in other modules, as most topics in sociology cannot be discussed in isolation.

#### Learning Objectives    {#import-auto-id1163653050700}

Every module begins with a set of clear and concise learning objectives. These objectives are designed to help the instructor decide what content to include or assign, and to guide the student with respect to what he or she can expect to learn. After completing the module and end-of-module exercises, students should be able to demonstrate mastery of the learning objectives.

#### Key Features   {#import-auto-id1163653046556}

The following features show students the dynamic nature of sociology:

* **Sociological Research:** Highlights specific current and relevant research studies. Examples include “Is Music a Cultural Universal?” and “Deceptive Divorce Rates.”
* <strong>Sociology in the Real World: </strong>Ties chapter content to student life and discusses sociology in terms of the everyday. Topics include “Secrets of the McJob” and “Grade Inflation: When Is an A Really a C?”
* <strong>Big Picture: </strong>Features present sociological concepts at a national or international level, including “Education in Afghanistan” and “American Indian Tribes and Environmental Racism.”
* <strong>Case Study: </strong>Describes real-life people whose experiences relate to chapter content, such as “Catherine Middleton: The Commoner Who Would Be Queen.”
* **Social Policy and Debate:** Discusses political issues that relate to chapter content, such as “The Legalese of Sex and Gender” and “Is the U.S. Bilingual?”
* **Careers in Sociology:** Explores the lives and work of those in careers in sociology, including the real-world issues and debates these professionals encounter on a daily basis.

#### Section Summaries   {#import-auto-id1163652709734}

Section summaries distill the information in each section for both students and instructors down to key, concise points addressed in the section.

#### Key Terms   {#import-auto-id1163649630021}

Key terms are bold and are followed by a definition in context. Definitions of key terms are also listed in the Glossary, which appears at the end of the module online and at the end of the chapter in print.

#### Section Quizzes   {#import-auto-id1163649401488}

Section quizzes provide opportunities to apply and test the information students learn throughout each section. Both multiple-choice and short-response questions feature a variety of question types and range of difficulty.

#### Further Research   {#import-auto-id1163649531314}

This feature helps students further explore the section topic and offers related research topics that could be explored.
